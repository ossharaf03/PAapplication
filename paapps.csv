2obo7732,,,,"I’m applying to be a peer advisor again because of the experience I’ve had in the role these past two years. Originally, I wanted to be a PA in order to pay forward the experience that I had as a freshman. After a second year of going through training, WW, and PRDV, I want to be a PA again to be able to continue helping students with their transitions as well as guide first year PAs through the process. I’ve had amazing wildcat welcomes; my students have been talkative and engaged well with TNDs and other activities. Each year, it feels incredibly rewarding to answer questions and help students through the same problems that I experienced during my transition. I owe a lot of that to my board groups and the support I’ve received along the way. The returning PAs in my board groups have been able to share their perspectives and tips for how to keep the freshmen engaged during what can be a tiring week. I hope that as a third year PA I can do the same and help others to have a positive PA experience. In addition to helping new PAs, I want to be a third year PA to better support my students. The more time I spend as a student at NU, the more familiar I become with the different opportunities and resources that the school offers and the more I can share with freshmen in terms of advice and guidance.","I believe that the role of a returning PA in a board group and the larger PA community is to act as almost a mini board group member. Although PALTCs and PA camp do a lot to prepare PAs for wildcat welcome, there are always unexpected situations that arise that a PA might not know how to deal with. By offering our own experiences and insights, returning PAs can help guide new PAs through these things. Board members have a lot to do during WW and when someone sends a question into the board groupchat, having people familiar with WW who can answer questions lets the board focus on their own responsibilities. Most of all, I think the role of returning PAs is to help build the great community and energy that the PA community is known for. Having returning PAs lead by example for things like bringing the insane, 3 Celsius in the morning energy on day 4 of PA training or getting everyone together for board group dinners or capture the flag helps to make the PA community so fun and inclusive. I always feel at home in the PA community and I think it’s my responsibility to create a space where all PAs, new and returning, feel the same.","In order to best support my students, I will use my past experiences and what I have learned from PALTCs. As a heterosexual, cisgender, white, male student, I understand that the experiences I have had at Northwestern and the ways that I approach situations may not be the same as other students. In order to best support my students I want to lean on the experiences of my friends of different identities, learn of different campus resources that may not apply to me during PALTC and PA training, and reflect on how my own identities have shaped my NU experience. In my past two years as a PA, I have had around 30 students in my PA group, each coming from vastly different backgrounds. From these experiences, I have gained insight on how the transition can be different for students from different regions or countries or students of other different identities. While I understand that not everyone of a certain identity experiences that identity the same way, I hope to use what I have learned from past students to guide how I approach situations with future students. I also understand that learning about identities is an ongoing process. I hope that I can encourage productive dialogues so that the students in my group can feel comfortable sharing their own experiences and identities so that they can learn from each other and feel supported within our group.","I believe that it is important for returning PAs to go through training alongside new PAs both to be a resource for new PAs and to refresh ourselves on what we have previously learned and anything that has changed year over year. Although I believe that I have learned a lot from my two years as a PA, I know I still have lots more to learn. Each year, members of my board group have brought new perspectives and taught me things that I wouldn’t have learned otherwise. Even in activities that stayed the same year over year, like learning about the W curve, stories and questions from others help me to understand nuances which I had missed in the past. It is also important for returning PAs to go through training because of how much changes year to year. From small things like renamed offices to big things like a new Student Body TND and new PA dance, I wouldn’t be able to support my students to the best of my ability if I didn’t have PALTC and PA camp to refresh myself on what I know, fill in the gaps of what I’ve forgotten, and teach me what’s new."
2qll0008,"I believe that I would be a good Peer Advisor because I’m very well equipped with campus, both in terms of student organizations and University policies, geography, etc. As far as student organizations, I have been or am a part of several groups of different kinds, from academic groups like the Society of Physics Students and the Northwestern Undergraduate Mathematics Society, to affinity groups like oSTEM and Spectra, to performance groups such as New Movement Project, Eight Counts Ballet Company, and various Student Theatre boards. In terms of University policies, I believe that I have educated myself about and interacted with far more of them than the average sophomore has. I know by heart the degree requirements, for example, for dance, mathematics, theatre, physics, chemistry, biology, and linguistics; I can offer my experience with dropping or withdrawing from classes, with overloads, with different kinds of university academic advising, and with registering for summer classes and managing aid for the Summer Quarter. I also, along the same token, have built very strong relationships with several faculty members, and these have led to me learning about several experiences that I wouldn’t otherwise have known anything about; I could help students, then, to build better relationships more quickly with faculty whose work interests them, so that they could better involve themselves academically right off the bat, if they so desire.","My transition to Northwestern was very smooth insofar as performance opportunities, and I owe that to my Peer Advisor, who was very knowledgeable about student groups related to both the Theatre and Dance programs. I believe that I could model similar advising in order to also give my advisees a very easy extracurricular transition. However, socially, my transition was rough and painful. I didn’t feel that I had any meaningful relationships with any of my peers until the social quarter, and I believe that the reason is that I was too afraid to join groups that didn’t directly relate to my majors. Despite my being very deeply interested in everything from chemistry to board games, I was worried that I couldn’t meaningfully contribute anything to a club if I wasn’t already an expert in the topic. I feel that I could assuage any similar fears my advisees might have about that transition, because, clearly, that fear was unfounded in hindsight; I’ve tried out several different clubs, and all of them have welcomed me with open arms, and I feel that, in sharing those anecdotes with incoming students, I could help them to kickstart their own social transitions without that paralyzing fear of rejection. Moreover, because I’ve had some involvement with so many organizations, I could potentially help them figure out which clubs they may want to join, or point them towards a friend who may already be in the club to give them a better rundown than any website could.","As someone who comes from a very rural, low-income area with an even-lower-income family, I am deeply acquainted with the financial aid policies that aren’t immediately apparent, and I believe that having that information earlier than I did could have saved me a lot of headache. Moreover, as someone who comes from poverty, I feel that I have a unique perspective on the social scenes that exist throughout campus. So many more aspects of college life in a suburb require money than I believe most people, even other students, realize, but I know how to budget for the CTA, and I have had to speak up with my friends to mention when dinner is a bit more expensive than I can manage. As such, I feel that I can help to prepare students for that reality, but also to empower them to speak up for themselves, and to educate themselves, not only about what activities can be done cheaply, but also which Chicago events have flexible pricing options that might be a little less obvious than one might hope. Along the same vein, I can let my students know about SAAF and the OneForm; both that they exist and how to use them, and also that they shouldn’t be embarrassed to take advantage of these opportunities for help. In particular, I would mention the winter clothing aid on the OneForm, because no one is ever prepared for their first Chicago winter.",,,,
2uqs2526,"I would be a good Peer Advisor because I love helping people navigate new things, especially if I have been in their shoes and have the tools to help them, and because I am a strong and energetic leader. I feel like I learned a lot from my PA, and I would love to be able to pass on the things that stuck with me, as well as what I have collected on my own, to a new class of Freshman and pay it forward. They are going to be so excited to start this new chapter of their life, and I would be so excited to be able to welcome them to that and be a pillar to support them in this transition. As their PA, I want to be able to match their energy and calm their nerves because, even though this is a fun time, it's also a scary time in a lot of ways. I feel like I have the leadership traits to be able to lead my group with empathy and understanding, hopefully creating a safe first space and impression of Northwestern.","I had a very fun and comfortable transition to Northwestern. Not everything was perfect, but I felt very safe and welcomed in my PA group and throughout welcome week. I am still best friends with the two people I met in this group because of how awesome our dynamic was, and I want to be able to recreate that in my group. Even if it's just for one student, I hope to be able to make this transition just a little bit smoother, more welcoming, and comforting.","I am a gay, multiracial student of a single mom and immigrant parent with a twin in the military. I feel like I have a wide breadth of background knowledge and experiences to be able to relate with the incoming freshman about things that can be the most concerning during this transition, like identity and family. Obviously everyone reacts differently to change and has different relationships with those around them and themself, but I am confident that I can create a space in which the freshman can, at least, feel represented. There's often a lot of impostor syndrome coming into Northwestern, so it's important to set that record straight: everyone here deserves to be here, we aren't in high school anymore and this isn't like high school.",,,,
2aki8621,"How many MSE geeks do you know who were one of the highest selling part timers at a retail store? I can attribute my success to the fact that I was not afraid to approach people. In one instance, I started a conversation with a mother and daughter and learned that they were shopping for a concert outfit to go to one of my favorite artists. The connection led them to come back the next week as my personal clients! This experience not only strengthened my ability to engage with diverse individuals but also emphasized the importance of proactive communication.

Next, I held a similar position in highschool. We had a program called Violet Keys which was mainly volunteer-based students led tours for prospective families. Another component was that you could be invited to be an upperclassmen who would lead incoming students in our version of a wildcat welcome. I was invited to be a helper in my 8th grade year and a leader in my Junior and Senior years of highschool. It taught me not only how to break out of my own shell but also how to guide others through challenging transitions. 

These experiences uniquely position me to be an effective Peer Adviser, where I can leverage my skills in communication, leadership, and navigating transitions to support and guide my peers effectively.","My transition to Northwestern was hugely impacted by my Pear Advisor, which is why I want to apply. My transition to Northwestern was so seamless because of the support and environment that my PA created for our PA group. Before arriving, I was nervous that the stereotypes about engineers being on the more nonsocial side were true and that I wouldn’t make any meaningful connections with people in my PA group. Instead, what actually happened was that my PA focused on making sure that we put an emphasis on the social aspects of college life during our first week. Even beyond our time as a group, he encouraged us to go out, meet other people in our buildings, and  go to sports games. Because I had such a good experience with my PA, I want to pay it forward to incoming students and have as much of an impact on the next class.

When I told my PA that I was thinking about applying, I was met with so much enthusiasm. I asked him if he thought it was worth it, he said it was such a meaningful experience for him and that he can’t wait to go back for his third year.","As a Peer Adviser, I bring a 'work hard, play hard' mentality, exemplified by my active involvement in numerous campus clubs that strike a balance between social and academic pursuits. Through these affiliations, I've cultivated a broad network, which I believe will be instrumental in helping my advisees discover groups aligned with their interests.

My personal identities, particularly as a member of SWE and CSA, have profoundly shaped my college experience. Joining SWE provided me with a supportive community in a male-dominated field, significantly enhancing my time at Northwestern. Similarly, CSA became the first club to address my identity as someone who has attended predominantly white institutions throughout my educational career.

I see immense value in finding communities that resonate with aspects of one's identity that make them a minority. In my role as a Peer Adviser, I aim to leverage my experiences to guide incoming students in discovering such communities. I understand the importance of creating an inclusive environment and will actively contribute to fostering diversity and inclusion on campus, ensuring that every student feels supported and welcomed.",,,,
2hlx2820,,,,"In the past, my decision to apply was largely influenced by my first-year WW experience, and the positive environment and experiences I had because of my PA. This remains true, but my decision to reapply as a third-year PA is now mostly based on my experiences as a PA for the last two years. Each year has been incredibly exciting, eye-opening, and meaningful in its own way, from PALTCs to PA camp to WW itself. WW has been one of the main highlights of my year every year, and I’m beyond grateful for the PA community and all my students who have given me no doubt that I would love to do this for a third and final year. From beach nights and volleyball games with other PAs to late-night pool and bonfires with my students, I’ve made so many memories as a PA. And of course, one of the most important parts of being a PA has been having the opportunity to help new students transition to Northwestern. As a freshman, I felt very reassured having a PA I could talk to and ask for advice, and it’s been very meaningful for me to provide the same reassurance for my students, whether they’re looking for resources, lost in Tech, worried for genchem, wondering about extracurriculars, asking for food recs, feeling homesick, and so much more. I’ve loved being there for them, and it would be an honor to do it again.","Returning PAs can offer valuable insight based on their own experiences as a PA in the past. Although PA training and Wildcat Welcome often vary from year to year, the key takeaways and skills that are important for PAs to have remain similar each year. Because of this, returning PAs can contribute greatly to large- and small-group discussions by addressing the importance of certain topics, potential challenges, common concerns, ways to adapt to various situations, and helpful tips and resources they have learned of from being a PA before. In my experience, board members have very comprehensive presentations and advice, but every returning PA has had their own unique experiences, and having their voices in the board group helps to address topics from different perspectives. This helps to paint a better picture for all the PAs on what they might expect to happen during Wildcat Welcome and gives them more ideas on how to handle situations they may run into.

In addition to sharing their experiences during PALTCs and PA camp, returning PAs also play a big role in contributing to a positive environment within the PA community. From bonding within board groups to spending time with other PAs, returning PAs help tie the PA community together and spread excitement for Wildcat Welcome!","I think my prior knowledge from PALTCs and being a PA have taught me to be more mindful and considerate of new students’ individual needs. Students come from widely varying backgrounds and experiences, which can greatly affect how they experience Wildcat Welcome as well as their overall transitions to Northwestern. PALTCs provide PAs with space to reflect on how our identities have affected our own experiences at Northwestern, and how others’ identities may affect them in similar or different ways. Additionally, PALTCs provide us with more knowledge on the resources that Northwestern students can rely on for support, advice, community, and services (health, learning, etc.). These resources can be more or less helpful depending on the student’s personal experiences and identities (e.g. students who are international, of different racial/cultural/financial backgrounds, considering different majors, etc. who are seeking resources and/or want to talk about their concerns). For the past two years—and for this upcoming year if I am selected as a third-year PA—I commit to doing my very best in connecting my students to the proper resources and/or connecting them to people who are more familiar with their concerns and can provide more insight to help. Though I may not be able to fully understand how to help with a concern or navigate a specific situation, I will try my hardest to create an environment where they feel comfortable seeking help, and to assist them in their transitions to Northwestern.","I mentioned some of this in a previous question, but I believe that returning PAs play an important role in PALTCs and PA camp because their prior experiences as a PA give them unique perspectives and insights on challenges, advice, etc. that they can share with the rest of the board group to better prepare new PAs on what to expect. Returning PAs also help to create a positive environment for the PA community as a whole.

However, I also think that training with new PAs is beneficial to returning PAs. I was a returning PA last year, and although many of the key ideas in PALTCs and PA camp were similar to those in my first year as a PA, there were still new ideas brought up, and I found our small- and large-group discussions to be especially insightful. New PAs may not have experienced WW from a PA perspective yet, but they often bring up points that can be overlooked by returning PAs because new PAs come in with a fresh point of view. Additionally, many new PAs have just recently experienced WW from a new-student perspective, so they may be able to better anticipate how new students might feel and react to certain aspects of WW. As a rising senior, I feel further removed from my own freshman-year WW, so having this kind of insight from other PAs during training would be very helpful for me."
2vgn8013,"Firstly, I a variety of experiences which involve interpersonal skills. These include debate, theatre, camp counseling, and student government, all of which indicate my strengths for presentation and working with groups. I love things like ""get to know you"" games and making personal connections, and I have a lot of experience with them to know what works and what doesn't. 
Secondly, I am really passionate about my major of political science and the Kaplan program. Especially with the Kaplan program, I feel that participating in this was the best decision I've made with my time here at Northwestern. I feel like I can be a good representative to incoming students for these, and help them feel excited about it. ","I really enjoyed Wildcat Welcome and getting to know my PA group, and I'm still close friends with several of the people from that PA group, and I think a good part of the reason for that is the work done by our PA to get us to know each other and bond. I want to be able to help foster those same kinds of connections.","In full honesty and self-awareness, I understand that as a white man I am not representative of any group that may be seeking identity fellowship, be that women, LGBTQ+ members or BIPOC individuals. What I can say though is that I have been surrounded by diversity my entire life as a result of my experiences, actvities, and community, and I hope to be a good representation for allyship here at Northwestern.",,,,
2icy8195,"I used to be a camp counselor which helped me get along and lead people I just met, as well as provide advice and guidance to them. This experience also aided my skills in time management, specifically in regards to a group of people. Additionally, I was a tour guide for my high school which helped me think on my feet and inform people about my past school in a positive and constructive way.","My PA advisors in Medill were essential in helping my transition to Northwestern run smoothly. I met some of my good friends in my PA group as well, and I want to bring that same experience to the new students at NU. I think the first week is pivotal in setting you up for a good college foundation and I want to be a part of the team who helps students fall in love with NU.","I am a transracial adoptee raised by a single mother, yet many people from the outside do not realize that I carry these identities. This has taught me that everyone has personal identities they carry with them throughout life even if not always visible. I hope to carry this lesson in my time as a PA to better empathize, guide and develop a friendship with new students.",,,,
2yaz9809,"The first reason I believe I would be a good Peer Advisor is that I believe in the importance of creating a sense of community for new students. As a mentor for new students, there are many ways I would be able to ensure a sense of community and belonging. This includes listening to new students, willing to answer questions, facilitating conversations around student voices, connecting students with others at Northwestern, sharing my own experiences, as well as many other ways to ensure new students feel they are part of a community whether that is in their own Peer Advisor group or in Northwestern as a whole. In addition to this, another reason I think I would be a good Peer Advisor is that I will ensure to create an environment around inclusivity. As a Peer Advisor, I would like to facilitate conversations as well as share resources surrounding diversity and inclusion. In addition to this, creating a space for new students grounded in inclusivity can also include ensuring that all student’s identities, emotions, experiences, and voices are heard and valued. I would like to ensure that as a Peer Advisor to new students, that they are comfortable and feel respected. I believe that I would be a good Peer Advisor because I would serve as a mentor through creating a sense of community as well as by emphasizing inclusivity.","Before coming to Northwestern, I was very unsure and worried about how I would fit into Northwestern. However, by the end of the Wildcat Welcome, I felt a larger sense of belonging at Northwestern. I think a part of why I had a smooth transition into Northwestern was largely due to my Peer Advisor as well as Peer Advisor group. My Peer Advisor ensured that everyone was comfortable as well as made it clear that she was a resource that everyone would be able to come to. In addition to this, I instantly became friends with many of the people in my Peer Advisor group, and I still am friends with people in my Peer Advisor group. It was very affirming to know that I would be able to rely on not only my Peer Advisor, but additionally my peers in my group. I believe that my experience with Wildcat Welcome is a significant driver and influence to my desire to be a Peer Advisor. As a Peer Advisor, I would like to help incoming students have the most smooth transition they can have. I found my experience with Wildcat Welcome to be very positive and would like to hopefully replicate that experience to other students. I hope as a Peer Advisor, I would be able to serve as a mentor and a resource the same way my Peer Advisor did to me during my transition to Northwestern.","As a first-generation college student, prior to arriving at Northwestern, I was riddled with anxiety and endless questions surrounding academics, social life, career guidance, and overall did not feel prepared for college. However, after meeting with my Peer Advisor as well as other students who had similar experiences and feelings, I felt more confident with my decision to come to Northwestern as well as a larger sense of belonging. I believe my personal identity, especially as a first-generation student, will be an asset to the way I would be as a Peer Advisor to new students. I find that my emotions surrounding my transition to Northwestern to be something many students can relate to. I hope to use my past and current experiences as a first-generation student to serve as a mentor to new students who may have similar experiences to me.  I would like to support new students through helping them with resources on campus, connect with other students, as well as just serving as a mentor to new students. I believe as a Peer Advisor, I would like to create a sense of community and belonging for students which I found to be important during my own transition to Northwestern. I hope my own personal identities, especially as a first-generation student, will help new students with their transition to Northwestern.",,,,
2Gxo0337,"1: I would be a good peer advisor because I love new people. I love to talk, and I love to learn about people. Nothing makes me happier than having a conversation where I walk away knowing someone better. I know each person is different in how they transition, and I am prepared to adapt to each individual. I would never force students to do something that makes them uncomfortable- I understand optional events and opportunities to speak are a dream for some students, and a nightmare for others. I would seek to work with my group instead of having them “follow the leader” all day, and make the time during welcome week the most valuable I can. 
2: I am a leader. Group dynamics can be complicated, but I understand how to corral a group. I understand the balance between using compromise and forcefulness, between empathy and accountability, and between vision and adaptability. Decision making is something I pride myself on, but I know that decisions and plans can change. I would treat my group with respect and empathy, and expect the same from them. If I am having issues, or one of my students are, I know how to problem solve and if need be, ask for help. ","Coming to Northwestern was one of the biggest transitions of my life. Not knowing a single person, my usually extraverted self wanted to shrink into the background. When my PA saw this, she made sure to always include me in conversation, and help me bond with the rest of my group. She laughed at my awkward jokes and asked me questions about my life. It was because of the comfortability that I felt with my PA group that I decided to join three clubs I knew nothing about and run for ASG senate. I now feel like Northwestern is my home. I have a busy schedule- which I love- and involvements that keep me motivated. Although I love this school, my transition is not over. I have so many people to meet, classes to take, and clubs to join. I know that the transition to Northwestern doesn’t end after welcome week, and so neither would my responsibility as a PA. As a PA, I want to make sure my group finds their people and their place- wherever that is. I want to be a resource, as my PA was for me, and ensure the class of 2028 loves this school as much as I do.","As a gay student, I have the impact of representation. My presence may create a more inclusive and welcoming environment, making it easier for students with similar identities to connect and feel supported. Being part of student government has heightened my awareness of social issues, policies, and systemic challenges for the northwestern community in particular. As a Jewish student, I believe in my ability to provide my students (of any religion) the religious resources they need. The different facets of my identity may enable me to facilitate open and respectful dialogue around diverse perspectives. As a PA, I believe sharing parts of my identity can provide students with a trusting and inclusive space and help introduce them to the different parts of a Northwestern community.",,,,
2arb5631,,,,"I inevitably get so mushy writing about why I love this position. I’ve had the privilege to be in boards full of incredible, kind-hearted people who helped me grow as a PA and a person. Some are now my closest friends! That level of connection was a huge part of why I came back last year, and the sentiment remains. Though I’d like to believe that the Zhanshines and Hotel Patel were just exceptionally cool (and did I mention better than everybody else?), I know I would’ve made just as great connections with any combination of the PA community. I’m applying again for another year surrounded by the drive, heart, generosity, and love that makes PAs so special. I’m sure this is echoed by plenty of returners, but this is genuinely my favorite group of students on campus. And this year is extra special because I get to watch people I’ve grown with both during and beyond Wildcat Welcome absolutely kill it as board members, which is such a joy. Of course, the PAs are only half the equation—I’m also looking forward to my third group of students. Having started in Weinberg with 11 boys and 1 girl in a STEM seminar and switched to SESP with 8 students and a co-PA, in some ways I feel like I haven’t actually gotten to be a returning PA yet. I’m so excited to be a SESP PA again having learned from the unique challenges and opportunities it brings to the table.","Being a returning Peer Advisor is a really special role. While the Board (hi) is a great resource for preparing and training PAs, the more people available to provide advice and insight the better. A returning PA has the experience and knowledge to be an additional resource for new PAs in the room and for each other. It’s an incredibly fulfilling feeling to be able to pass on guidance and advice to new PAs that was given to you or that you learned when you were in their shoes. That said, as a returner it can feel like there’s always something to share. Especially during PALTCs, returners have a responsibility to monitor their air time and make sure they’re not dominating the conversation—giving space for new PAs to contribute and engage in active learning, and not stepping on their Board member’s toes. Returning Peer Advisers should also exemplify the values of the PA community for new PAs and each other. That includes paying attention during presentations, not whining about doing training again, not closing yourself off from making new friends just because PAs you already know are in your board, being welcoming and friendly to new faces in the room, and showing engagement and enthusiasm in the work we do as PAs. We talk so often about the passion, connection, and strength of the PA community, and maintaining that environment is reliant on returning PAs embodying those values so that new PAs can learn to embody them themselves.","I think one of the most important things PALTC content on identity teaches you is the importance of recognizing your positionality (SESP love) and the way your identities affect the way you interact with your students. I’m a white, female U.S. citizen from a high school with exceptional history and sex education, I’m not first-gen in either sense, and I don’t receive financial aid. I am undeniably extremely privileged compared to many of my peers. Because of this, I make sure to learn about resources and events that may not apply to me but are incredibly useful to others so that I can best serve my students as a PA. In recognition that many identities are not outwardly visible, either at all or in a stereotypical manner, I do my best to never assume what knowledge, experiences, and resources my students are coming in with, or ask them to share things about themselves they don’t volunteer. I share the resources I know about with all my students, not just the ones I think they might pertain to. Lastly, but crucially, we talk in PALTC about the importance of leaning on other PAs as resources for yourself and your students. When a student comes to me looking for resources related to an identity I don’t hold, I share with them what I know/find but I also offer to connect them with a PA who holds that identity so that they can receive more personal and experience-based guidance.","I get why in theory some people don’t like repeating the training—last year I definitely worried about being overly bored. That wasn’t the case at all. The reality is returning PAs need to re-train because there are new things to learn every year. New Wildcat Welcome structure, new resources, new TND formats, oh my! In my second year of training I learned about a ton of resources I hadn’t known about during my first year as a PA, many of which I shared with my students and they subsequently used. I got information about the new format of the Student Body TND, which helped me figure out how best to prepare my students. But most importantly, I was surrounded by new people to learn from. I think the training with the new PAs aspect is important because they may be new to the PA community, but they’re well familiar with the school and Wildcat Welcome, and they bring important new perspectives and experiences to the table. I learned so much from the first-years in my board over PALTCs and PA Camp—from how to best approach difficult situations to ways to make TNDs more exciting. Also, the PAs are such a tight-knit community, and that doesn’t spontaneously happen in the short (now shorter!) span of Wildcat Welcome. If returners were to train separately from the newcomers, especially during PA camp, there’d be so little room for the connection and bonding that makes the PA community so special."
2ecy2082,"Throughout my time at Northwestern so far, there have been so many people who have supported me along the way and given me advice and mentorship. This has taught me how important it is to have a support network and the value in having people you can ask questions and look to for encouragement. For me, my PA was someone I could be honest with and someone I looked up to for advice and support. Just as I have been blessed with amazing mentors here, I hope to be a similar mentor for the incoming freshmen. I know how hard being in McCormick can be and how there are days when you are battling imposter syndrome, lack of sleep, the pressure to succeed, and more, and so I hope to support my PA students in all of their joys and struggles, especially as they transition into a very different environment. In addition to my desire to support incoming students, I love working with people. I want to get to know their stories and perspectives and work through challenges to expand my worldview and who I am as a person. I am excited to meet other PA’s, work together in our training, share the excitement of meeting our PA students, and finally get to actually work with the students to create an environment where they feel safe and welcomed so that they have the opportunity to really enjoy some of the best years of their lives.","Coming to Northwestern for the first time I didn’t know what to expect. Both of my older siblings went to the same large state school and even then I largely navigated the college application and preparation process alone. I was very nervous about adapting to the new environment, making friends, and figuring out how to be successful academically. Wildcat Welcome and the summer program I participated in (SAW), were two very important pillars in making me feel comfortable at Northwestern, aware of the resources available to me, and connecting me with people that I am still friends with today. The activities and discussions that I participated in during Wildcat Welcome really helped smooth my transition into living in a new environment for the first time and figuring out how to take care of myself on my own. I am really grateful for those opportunities and that has inspired me to apply to be a Peer Adviser. I know how valuable those experiences are and that perspective equips me to be ready for the fears and desires that incoming freshmen may have. It was a lot of the small things that had a big impact on me like having lunch on the lakefill during Wildcat Welcome and just feeling really at peace and hopeful as my PA group shared lunch and played games or when my PA came to my DTC expo to support me. In the same way I hope to leave a warmhearted impact on my PA students.","Many of my personal identities allow me to resonate with students who are the ‘first’ and the ones who have felt like a minority in the spaces they’ve grown up in. They may be the ones who are paving the way for their families, who are the first to have many opportunities, the first to experience registering for classes, picking their major, and walking the stage at graduation. As someone who is a first generation college and engineering student and the first to pursue a medical career in my family, I understand the pressure and fears that come with going to college with these identities. I am also a woman studying a male dominated discipline, I came from a high school where Asians were less than 1% of the student body, and even now I am navigating being a low income student at Northwestern. I believe that the nuances of my identities and my experiences that shape them allow me to have empathy for the identities of people around me and give me insight on how people’s various identities may impact how they approach something as big as attending college. As a PA I would want all of my students to feel safe and welcomed and so I want to create a space where no one is judged based on any of their identities, where they can feel comfortable experiencing things for the first time, asking questions, feeling validated, and knowing that there is space for everyone here at Northwestern.",,,,

The gifts I’ve received weren’t packaged in fancy boxes with bows or ones children excitedly open on birthdays. My Onx aortic valve that beats underneath my sternum is a gift. The fact that my condition was identified shortly after birth is a gift. I simply wouldn’t be alive without the gift of giving. Living with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, my life depends on medical research funded by generous donors. My adversity unveiled that good exists in this world. I am determined to go above and beyond to ensure that first-years have the resources to achieve their goals at Northwestern, just like surgeons have spent hours in an operating room to give me the opportunity to achieve mine.
	
In addition, my organizational skills and character will enable me to be an excellent PA. Since childhood, I have a habit of meticulously mapping out my schedules and tasks, while learning to adapt to unexpected situations. My sociable personality will comfort students in this unfamiliar environment, as I am eager to meet new people. As someone with a warm and welcoming PA, the environment my PA created within our group empowered myself and my peers to break out of our shells and get to know one another. I hope to do the same for my future PA group. As a PA, I will be able to give back to the Northwestern community I feel so deeply connected to and grateful for.
","Coming into Northwestern, I had a wide variety of emotions. In addition to the normal “moving away from home jitters,” I was nervous about what life would look like in Evanston, not only as a person of color, but especially as a disabled student. As aforementioned in my application, while I had the resources for disabled students on campus put in front of me, I had to learn how to navigate them on my own. This created lots of stress and anxiety, especially as I envisioned my life in Evanston for the coming years. This new beginning in a first-year’s life is meant to be enjoyable and a little nerve-wracking, but the added stress and anxiety is unnecessary for disabled students. I can speak from experience.

I arrived on campus being nervous to ask questions concerning the resources available to me as a disabled student because I felt like an inconvenience, especially to those who hadn’t shared similar experiences. At the time, I didn’t know how to request my accommodations in the ANU portal or schedule exams with Testing Services, and neither did the people that surrounded me. Being open about my disability and initial struggles to my PA group will create an environment where they are not scared to ask questions about the resources we deserve. 

Being a Peer Adviser will empower me to make the transition into college a little more enjoyable by reducing stress- and anxiety-inducing factors that play into the life of a disabled Northwestern student. 


","As Wildcat Welcome commenced, I observed many people from differing backgrounds and learned about the various resources available to me as a student. Being a disabled student in the Northwestern community, I quickly noticed that I was surrounded by able-bodied individuals, especially able-bodied Peer Advisers. Unlike many Peer Advisers, I will be able to better the Wildcat Welcome environment for those with disabilities. While I was always pointed in the right direction of resources that were available to me as a student with a disability, I was left to my own devices to navigate the systems within those resources. As a disabled Peer Adviser, I will be prepared to help incoming students navigate ANU, consult their professors with any concerns they may have regarding their disability, schedule exams with Testing Services, or even offer a shoulder to lean on when their disability disrupts their lives. I would additionally dedicate time to educate non-disabled students about the resources available to disabled students, so they can offer a support system for the disabled community on campus. This would establish communal togetherness, informing disabled students that they are not alone. In doing so, I hope to make the transition onto campus a little easier for students who have extra anxiety as a disabled student encountering this next chapter of their lives on their own. Having this advice and experience as a Peer Adviser would have made all the difference in my transition into my life as a Wildcat.",,,,
